# Hostel Accommodation & Management System

This project is a database-driven hostel management application that automates student management, room allocation, fee tracking, booking, complaint handling and pending dues monitoring. The application uses Python with Streamlit for the user interface and MySQL as the backend database, along with automated triggers, functions, views and stored procedures.

## How to Run This Project

1. Install Python and MySQL on your system.  
2. Import the SQL database file provided with the project.  
3. Install the required Python packages using the included requirements file.  
4. Configure database connection by entering **your own MySQL username and password** inside the project configuration file.  
   This ensures that the system connects to **your local MySQL server** instead of using someone else’s database credentials.  
5. Start the application from the main file and open the interface through the browser to access all modules.  

---

## Important Configuration Note

During setup, the user must enter **their own MySQL database username and password**, as the project does not include default credentials.  
This step is mandatory for establishing a successful database connection, and using incorrect or empty credentials will result in connection errors.

Example (where to set credentials is guided inside project files):
• Replace placeholder values with your actual database username and password  
• Ensure MySQL server is running before starting the application
